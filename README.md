üåßÔ∏è RAIN PREDICTION MODEL

A machine learning-based project that predicts the likelihood of rainfall using historical weather data. This project leverages supervised learning algorithms to help make data-driven decisions in meteorology, agriculture, and disaster management.

Project Overview:


Rain prediction is a key task in weather forecasting, and timely predictions can significantly impact agriculture, transportation, and daily planning. In this project, we explore various meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure to train a model that predicts whether it will rain or not.

Problem Statement:

Given a dataset containing historical weather observations, the objective is to build a classification model that predicts the occurrence of rain on a particular day.
