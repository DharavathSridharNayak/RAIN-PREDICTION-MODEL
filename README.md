üåßÔ∏è RAIN PREDICTION MODEL

A machine learning-based project that predicts the likelihood of rainfall using historical weather data. This project leverages supervised learning algorithms to help make data-driven decisions in meteorology, agriculture, and disaster management.

Project Overview:


Rain prediction is a key task in weather forecasting, and timely predictions can significantly impact agriculture, transportation, and daily planning. In this project, we explore various meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure to train a model that predicts whether it will rain or not.


Features Used:

Minimum/ Maximum Temperature

Rainfall

Humidity

Wind Speed and Direction

Atmospheric Pressure

Cloud Cover

Rain Today

Technologies Used:


Python

Pandas & NumPy ‚Äì Data processing

Matplotlib & Seaborn ‚Äì Data visualization

Scikit-learn ‚Äì Model building and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab ‚Äì Development environment

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):


Handled missing values and outliers

Visualized correlations between weather features

Performed feature selection and transformation

Checked data imbalance and applied necessary techniques


Machine Learning Models:
