🌧️ RAIN PREDICTION MODEL

A machine learning-based project that predicts the likelihood of rainfall using historical weather data. This project leverages supervised learning algorithms to help make data-driven decisions in meteorology, agriculture, and disaster management.

Project Overview:


Rain prediction is a key task in weather forecasting, and timely predictions can significantly impact agriculture, transportation, and daily planning. In this project, we explore various meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure to train a model that predicts whether it will rain or not.


Features Used:

Minimum/ Maximum Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity, Atmospheric Pressure, Cloud Cover, Rain Today


Technologies Used:


Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data processing

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – Development environment

Machine Learning Model:


Random Forest Classifier


Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
